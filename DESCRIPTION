Package: plotDK
Title: Plot Summary Statistics as Choropleth Maps of Danish Administrative Areas
Description: Provides a ggplot2 front end to plot summary statistics on danish provinces,
    regions, municipalities, and zipcodes. The needed geoms of each of the four levels are 
    inherent in the package, thus making these types of plots easy for the user. This is essentially 
    an updated port of the previously available 'mapDK' package by Sebastian Barfort.
